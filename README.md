# Node_CRUD

I created a small NodeJS application which performs CRUD operation on MongoDB database. I used mlab cloud database for this app and POSTMAN tool for testing the API calls.
Basic idea behind this application is to have a MVC (Module-View-Control) framework where M-module is the code for database, V-view is the graphical representation of application (User-interface) and C-controller is the logic to handle incoming request and outgoing responses.
